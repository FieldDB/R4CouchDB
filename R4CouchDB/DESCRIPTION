Description: The R4CouchDB package provides a collection of functions for
             basic database and document management operations such as add  and
             delete. Every cdbFunction() gets and emits a list containing the
             connection set up.
             With the cdbIni() function the cdb$serverName is set to
             "localhost" as a default. This means that localhost should
             provide a CouchDB. The example sections in the Rd files (man
             section) run with
             http://wactbprot.couchone.com.
             This allows to provide (more or less) real examples.
             Many thanx to the couchone relaxers
