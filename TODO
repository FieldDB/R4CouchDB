- function for view requests
-- done, but without params as ..?group=true
--- done

- post and update files
-- postFile done
-- skip postFile and updateFile out; this makes no sense
   since everyone knows best (better) how to handle with specific
   files resp. file structures ...
- give more consequent names to cdb list entry's, e.g. $noOfUuids is
  at least a $queryParam
-- done

- localhost is mostly not the right server; maybe it's a good idea to set a
  enviroment var

+++ after this is done I make a R package structure!

- a function cdbDelDoc is missing
- before returning the list the answer should be more evaluated

- replication?
- writing Tests -> RUnit package provides infrastructure
