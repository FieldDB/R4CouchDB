problem:
workaround for error which occurs while updating (cdbUpdateDoc())
relative large (~40k) data sets.
curl=cdb$curl -> #curl=cdb$curl

supplement:
I was not able to reproduce the error at home 
(in a different network topology, 
different data but same (actualy bigger) size)
maybe there is no need to use V0.41 ...
I'll find it out!  

advice:
there is a new version of RJSONIO:
Last Release: 0.3-1 (08 Sep 2010)
