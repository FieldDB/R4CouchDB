Description: The R4CouchDB package provides a collection of functions
        for basic database and document management operations such as
        add and delete. Every cdbFunction() gets and emits a list
        containing the connection set up. A unit test structure using
        the RUnit package is preliminary prepared. With the cdbIni()
        function the cdb$serverName is set to "localhost" as a default.
        This means that localhost should provide a CouchDB. All
        (former) example sections in the man pages are removed; the
        unit test structure is intended to cover the example task with
        more and easier control.
